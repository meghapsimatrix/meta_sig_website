***Adapting Methods for Correcting Selective Reporting Bias in Meta-Analysis of Dependent Effect Sizes***

- Speaker: [Dr. Man Chen](https://education.utexas.edu/faculty/man_chen/), University of Texas at Austin

- Description: Various methods have been proposed to adjust for selective reporting bias in average effect size estimates under the assumption that each study produces one effect size. However, there remains a need to investigate the selection bias adjustment methods in meta-analysis with multiple, dependent effect sizes. In this presentation, I will demonstrate novel adaptations of several adjustment methods based on a multivariate working model and weighting scheme that correct for selective reporting bias while handling dependencies among effect sizes. I will present the performance of existing adjustment methods and the novel adaptations based on an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study. I will conclude with a discussion of limitations, future directions, and suggestions for correcting selection bias in the context of dependent effect sizes. The presentation will cover research described in a pre-print available at https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/jq52s.

***Friday the 13th & Single Case Experimental Designs: Allegedly Unlucky Encounters for Meta-Analysts***

- Speakers: [Dr. John Ferron](https://www.usf.edu/education/faculty/faculty-profiles/john-ferron.aspx), University of South Florida,
and [Dr. Megan Kirby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-megan-kirby-54b2a211/), Language Dynamics Group

- Description: With increased use of single-case experimental designs to study intervention effects, there is a greater need to include single-case experimental design studies in meta-analyses. In this session, we will discuss alternative methods for estimating effects from single-case studies, illustrate the estimation of these effects from freely available software apps, and provide guidance about choosing among the effect size options.

***Using GPT API Models as Second Screeners of Titles and Abstracts in High-Quality Systematic Reviews***

- Speaker: [Dr. Mikkel Vembye](https://www.vive.dk/en/staff/mikkel-helding-vembye-568r9kvr/), Danish Center for Social Science Research

- Description: Independent human double screening of titles and abstracts is a critical step to ensure the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, double screening is a resource-demanding procedure that slows down the review process. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how reviewers reliably can implement OpenAI’s GPT models as second screeners of title and abstracts to mitigate this resource demand. I will provide a practical demonstration of how to conduct title and abstract screening with GPT API models through the newly developed R package AIscreenR and highlight how the approach differs from simply using the ChatGPT interface. I will discuss implementation requirements for ensuring performance that is at least on par with typical human screening. To facilitate this, I will introduce a new screening benchmark scheme that is based on common human screening performance in 22 large-scale systematic reviews. As the initial proof of concept, I will present results of using GPT API screening in three large classification experiments. I will conclude by discussing limitations and future directions for this screening method and how it can be combined with traditional (semi-)automated screening tools. The background for this presentation can be found at https://osf.io/preprints/osf/yrhzm.

***Fitting Flexible Meta-Analytic Models with Structural Equation Modeling***

- Speaker: [Dr. Mike Cheung](https://mikewlcheung.github.io/), National University of Singapore

- Description: Understanding the differences between various meta-analytic models, such as the fixed-effect, random-effects, and multiplicative error models, can be challenging for researchers. This presentation explains these models using a graphical representation within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Users specify meta-analytic models using lavaan syntax. The metaSEM package in R can convert these models to graphical models, model-implied mean and variance, and fit models using the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimation method. Complex meta-analytic models, such as multivariate meta-analysis and mediation models, can also be fitted. Users without strong statistical and programming backgrounds can still develop and implement novel meta-analytic models that are not available in standard meta-analysis software.
