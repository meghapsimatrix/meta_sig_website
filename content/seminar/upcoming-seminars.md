- Description: In this talk, I will provide an introduction to Individual Participant Data (IPD) meta-analysis projects [1]. I will explain their rationale, advantages and key steps, and discuss various examples including the examination of treatment effects, treatment-covariate interactions, test accuracy, prognostic factors and risk prediction models. I will also highlight some of their challenges and pitfalls. Intended for a broad audience, the talk will help those considering, undertaking or appraising IPD meta-analysis projects.
