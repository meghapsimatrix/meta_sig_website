***Synthesizing Qualitative Evidence in Education: Opportunities and Challenges of Meta-Aggregation***

- Speaker: [Dr. Yukiko Maeda](https://education.purdue.edu/faculty-profiles/name/yukiko-maeda/), Purdue University

- Description: This presentation introduces meta-aggregation as a systematic methodology for synthesizing qualitative evidence in education. Unlike interpretive approaches such as meta-ethnography, meta-aggregation is grounded in pragmatism and aims to preserve the original meanings of findings without reinterpretation, generating actionable recommendations that support evidence-based practice. Drawing on the recent applications in mathematics education, we outline the step-by-step process of meta-aggregation from extracting findings with supporting evidence, to categorizing them by shared meaning, to developing actionable recommendations. We discuss the promise and potential of this method for enhancing the transparency, usability, and practical relevance of qualitative synthesis in applied educational contexts. At the same time, we address key methodological challenges, including inconsistent reporting standards and the need for nuanced judgment when evaluating credibility. This session is designed for researchers and graduate students seeking structured, rigorous approaches to qualitative synthesis and for those aiming to better connect qualitative insights with educational policy and practice.
